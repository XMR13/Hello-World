'''
5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
should look something like this:
car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')
print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')
•
Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
evaluates to True or False.
•
Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and
another five tests evaluate to False.

print('Ruslan' == nama)
print('rus'==nama)
print('RUSLAN' == nama.upper())
print(['R','u','s','l','a','n'] == list(nama))
print('ruslan' == nama.lower())

'''5-2. More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you
create to ten. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests and add
them to conditional_tests.py. Have at least one True and one False result for
each of the following:
•
Tests for equality and inequality with strings
•
Tests using the lower() method
•
Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and
less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to
•
Tests using the and keyword and the or keyword
•
Test whether an item is in a list
•
Test whether an item is not in a list
