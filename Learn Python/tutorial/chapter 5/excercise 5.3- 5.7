5-3. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a
variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
•
Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print
a message that the player just earned 5 points.
•
Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that
fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
'''

'''5-4. Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 5-3, and
write an if-else chain.
•
If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned
5 points for shooting the alien.
•
If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned
10 points.
•
Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that
runs the else block

'''
alien_colour = (input("apakah warna alien itu? "))
if alien_colour.lower() == 'green':
    set_point = 5
else:
    set_point = 10

print(f'selamat anda mendapatkan {set_point} poin')

'''
5-5. Alien Colors #3: Turn your if-else chain from Exercise 5-4 into an if-elif-
else chain.
•
If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.
•
If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.
•
If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.
•
Write three versions of this program, making sure each message is printed
for the appropriate color alien.

'''
5-6. Stages of Life: Write an if-elif-else chain that determines a person’s
stage of life. Set a value for the variable age, and then:
•
If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is
a baby.
•
If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that
the person is a toddler.
•
If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that
the person is a kid.
•
If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that
the person is a teenager.

If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that
the person is an adult.
•
If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an
elder.
'''

5-7. Favorite Fruit: Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of
independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
•
Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.

is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement,
such as You really like bananas!
