'''5-8. Hello Admin: Make a list of five or more usernames, including the name
'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user
after they log in to a website. Loop through the list, and print a greeting to
each user:
•
If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin,
would you like to see a status report?
•
Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Jaden, thank you for
logging in again.
'''

usernames = ['jayden','napituli','Kobe','STAD','Admin']
for username in usernames:
    if username.lower() == 'admin':
        print("halo admin! apakah mau melihat status website ini? ")
    else:
        print(f'halo {username} selamat datang kembali')

'''5-9. No Users: Add an if test to hello_admin.py to make sure the list of users is
not empty.
•
If the list is empty, print the message We need to find some users!
•
Remove all of the usernames from your list, and make sure the correct
message is printed.
'''
usernames = ['jayden','napituli','Kobe','STAD','Admin']
if len(usernames) == 0:
    print("we need to find some Users!")
else:
    for username in usernames:
        if username.lower() == 'admin':
            print("halo admin! apakah mau melihat status website ini? ")
        else:
            print(f'halo {username} selamat datang kembali')

'''5-10. Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates
how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
•
Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
•
Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or
two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
•
Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already
been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a
new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying
that the username is available.
•
Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used,
'JOHN' should not be accepted. (To do this, you’ll need to make a copy of
current_users containing the lowercase versions of all existing users.)
'''
current_users = ['loki','zeus','medusa','Jupyter','Venus']
new_name = ['thor','zeus','Kortana','malefic','jupyter']
current_userslow = ['loki','zeus','medusa','jupyter','venus']
for username in new_name:
    if username in current_users or username in current_userslow:
        print("maaf nama yang anda ingin masukkan sudah terpakai")
    else:
        print(f'selamat datang diwebsite kami {username}')

'''5-11. Ordinal Numbers: Ordinal numbers indicate their position in a list, such
as 1st or 2nd. Most ordinal numbers end in th, except 1, 2, and 3.
•
Store the numbers 1 through 9 in a list.
•
Loop through the list.
•
Use an if-elif-else chain inside the loop to print the proper ordinal end-
ing for each number. Your output should read "1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th
7th 8th 9th", and each result should be on a separate line.
