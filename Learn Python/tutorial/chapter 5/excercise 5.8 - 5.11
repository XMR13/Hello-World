'''5-8. Hello Admin: Make a list of five or more usernames, including the name
'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user
after they log in to a website. Loop through the list, and print a greeting to
each user:
•
If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin,
would you like to see a status report?
•
Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Jaden, thank you for
logging in again.

    if username.lower() == 'admin':
        print("halo admin! apakah mau melihat status website ini? ")
    else:
        print(f'halo {username} selamat datang kembali')

'''5-9. No Users: Add an if test to hello_admin.py to make sure the list of users is
not empty.
•
If the list is empty, print the message We need to find some users!
•
Remove all of the usernames from your list, and make sure the correct
message is printed.
