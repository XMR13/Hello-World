'''4.3 Counting to Twenty: Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 20,
inclusive'''

oneToTwenty = sum([angka for angka in range(1,21)])
print(oneToTwenty)

'''4-4. One Million: Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and then
use a for loop to print the numbers. (If the output is taking too long, stop it by
pressing ctrl-C or by closing the output window.)'''
millionnum = [angka for angka in range (1,101)]
print (millionnum)

listbaru = []
for angkas in range(1,101):
    listbaru.append(angkas)

print(listbaru)


'''4-5. Summing a Million: Make a list of the numbers from one to one million,
#and then use min() and max() to make sure your list actually starts at one and
#ends at one million. Also, use the sum() function to see how quickly Python can
#add a million numbers. '''

onetomil = [angka for angka in range (1,1000001)]

print(max(onetomil))
print(min(onetomil))
sumnya = sum(onetomil)
print(sumnya)

'''4.6 Use the third argument of the range() function to make a
list of the odd numbers from 1 to 20. Use a for loop to print each number
'''
oddnumber = [odd for odd in range (1,21,2)]
print(oddnumber)

odd = []
for odda in range(1,21,2):
    odd.append(odda)
print(odd)

'''4.7 Make a list of the multiples of 3 from 3 to 30. Use a for loop to
print the numbers in your list.
'''
multiply3 = [three for three in range(3,31,3)]
print(multiply3)

'''
4-8. Cubes: A number raised to the third power is called a cube. For example,
the cube of 2 is written as 2**3 in Python. Make a list of the first 10 cubes (that
is, the cube of each integer from 1 through 10), and use a for loop to print out
the value of each cube
'''
for cube in range(1,11):
    print(cube**3)

'''4-9. Cube Comprehension: Use a list comprehension to generate a list of the
first 10 cubes.
'''
angka3 = [angka**3 for angka in range(1,11)]
print(angka3)
